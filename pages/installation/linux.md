# Linux Installation

Install your application on a Linux server using Embedded Cluster. Read the docs or select your deployment preferences.

## Requirements

See the [system requirements documentation](requirements) for the full list of prerequisites. At minimum:

- Ubuntu 20.04+ / RHEL 8+ / CentOS 8+
- 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM, 40GB disk minimum
- Root or sudo access

## Configuration

Customize the options below. The install commands will update automatically based on your selections.

<NetworkAvailability installType="linux" />

## Install

SSH into your target machine and run the following command as root or with sudo.

<LinuxInstallAssets />

## Verify Installation

Once the installer completes, it will print the URL for the admin console. Open it in your browser to continue with application setup.

<CommandBlock>
# Check that all pods are running
kubectl get pods -A

# Access the admin console
echo "Admin Console: https://$(hostname):8800"
</CommandBlock>
